## Getting started

To navigate our codebase with confidence, see the [project overview/documentation](https://joshuam1008.github.io/media-analyzer/).

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the project, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/joshuam1008/media-analyzer/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [template](https://github.com/joshuam1008/media-analyzer/issues/new/choose). 

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/joshuam1008/media-analyzer/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/filtering-and-searching-issues-and-pull-requests#filtering-issues-and-pull-requests-by-labels) for more information on how to do this. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.
- Using GitHub Desktop:
  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop#forking-a-repository)!

- Using the command line:
  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

1. Read through the [installation guide](INSTALL.md) and the [style guidelines](docs/style_guide.md).

2. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, we may ask questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
